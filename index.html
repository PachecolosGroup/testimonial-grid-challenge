                    <p>Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionais who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged in enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and matt dis not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have in fact, I've often referred to it during Interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers 100% recommenit!"</p>
